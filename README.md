# The Riff-Raff Mod

## Overview

A mod that shows popups and descriptions of acquired jokers and vouchers.

## Details and Known Issues

Should work alongside other mods, although specifically Cryptid does not seem to work correctly.

## Disclaimer

This mod was created at a specific streamer's request, and then made public as an afterthought (as I saw no reason to have it private). It is unlikely to receive updates or bugfixes, unless needed for its original purpose.
